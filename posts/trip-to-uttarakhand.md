India has more than 28 states and 8 union territories(UTs) and I had been to atleast 20 of those. I had never been to Uttarakhand ever. We had 1 week rest up week from our company and my birthday was falling in the same week. Last year around same time, I had planned trip to Andman & Nicobar Islans but then Covid-19 happened and plan was cancelled. This year, though pandemic still continues, the number of cases were quite low in March and I really wanted to use a 10 days of holiday to visit someplace new. I had been to Himachal earlir but only part of it, I wanted to visit the towns such as Dharmshala, Dalhousie etc.
