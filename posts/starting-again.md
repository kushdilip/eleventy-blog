There it is again. Another attemp at blogging. In past, I attempted multiple times to revive writing blogs but after first few days the enthusiam will die out. I tried to focus mainly on technical blog where I could post about web development, how to tutorials etc but the it's difficult to balance out between work, life & blogging. I have attempted at starting non-technical blogs where I could post about general topics but there are different issues altogether.

Many of these attempts were focused on setting up the blog using various static generators. I have tried Hugo, Gatsby and Ghost(Self Hosted) in the past.

Hugo being written in Go is blazing fast but templating was a bit tricky for me.

Gatsby is very feature reach but felt quite complicated with all the React, GraphQL etc. Most of the time went time used to go into choosing themes, integrating plugins. On top of that the build speed was quite slow compared to Hugo.

This time it's [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's static site generator written in Javscript and there options to choose multiple templating languages such as Nunjucks, handlebars, Liquid etc. I chose to go with Nunjucks for writing layout templates and Markdown for actual posts because of simplicity and familiarity. Eleventy is not as fast as Hugo but [sufficient snappy when compared to Gatsby or other SSGs](https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/).

It's not going to be purely technical or general blog this time but a mix of everything which can be tech, javascript, web development, philosophy, opinions, travel.

So Yay! Excited!
